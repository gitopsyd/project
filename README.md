These problems include:

* Validating that changes does not break the schema
* Migrating the schema
* Store a version of the last known good configuration
* Generating documentation for the schema
* Notify other systems when configuration changed

## Solution

The solution will be implemented using a combination of tools and techniques, including:

* Git
* Python / Rust / Golang / Typsecript / Other (TBD)
* Redis
* Github Actions
* Kafka

## Benefits

The benefits of the solution include:

* Improved efficiency when implementing GitOps
* Reduced costs for implementation of Kubernetes Operators
* Improved quality
* Increased compliance
